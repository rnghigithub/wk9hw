1. 
    - permits applications to store data within an individual user's browser.

2. What data storage was used before HTML5 was introduced? 
What was the data storage called and what was it included in?
- Before HTML5 application data was stored in cookies, included in each server request.
- 


3. What are 3 advantages of using the Web Storage API over cookies?

4. 
- localStorage And sessionStorage

5. 
- localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read client-side

6. Which data item can be read server-side? Why is it popular? What is it used mostly for? And what kind of data might it contain?

7.
- Cookies allow sites to store user data directly into the user's browser. This are majority used to identify the session, allowing the Web
server to recognize the user navigating through the site and may contain sensitive data.

8. 
- the httpOnly flag is good for blocking access of a cookie from client side and JavaScript coded. It mitigates the negative 
impact of an XSS (Cross Site Scripting) 

9. What are localStorage and sessionStorage of the Web Storage API connected to?
 And what does that connection make possible for pages from the same origin to do?

10. -
- permits you to set, retrieve and remove data for a specific domain and storage type. 

11. The Storage Object, represented by the localStorage and sessionStorage objects, contains one property.
 What is that property called and what does it return? Use your project application to describe 
 what this property does.

12. Give me the five Storage methods of the Web Storage API and describe what each does. 
When applicable, use code from your project application as examples.
 
 - Storage.clear() : when invoked, will empty all keys out of storage
    ex.
 
 - Storage.removeItem() : when passed a key name will remove that key from the storage. If not iten is associated with the given 
 key than this method will do nothing
    ex.

 - Storage.setItem() : when passed a key name and value will add that key to the storage/update that key's value if it already exists.       
    ex. 

 - Storage.getItem() : when passed a key name will return that key's value or null is the key is non-existent
   ex.

- Storage.key() : when passed a certain number represented by n, this method returns the name of the nth key in the storage.
    ex.      

13.
- The secure flag attribute allows you to forbid a cookie to be transmitted over HTTP. It will only be transmitted through HTTPS. 

14. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?

15. What are the similarities between localStorage and sessionStorage?

16. 
- try...catch statement marks a block of statements to try out code and specifics a response if an 
exception is thrown.

17. 
- If there is a sessionStorage support, the program steps into the else statement. 
There we set and get our sessionStorage with checking if we have exceeded the sessionStorage quota. 
Because the exception needs to be catched the try...catch statement must be used.

18. Explain what JSON.stringify() does and provide an example using code from your project application.

19. Describe what the value of the csv variable is and why it is important for our application.

20. Please copy and paste the result of the console.log(csv) after you have clicked on the Save Text To File For Download button. Hint: you should try this out only after you have completed building your application.
